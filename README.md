DDRectangleHelpers
==================

Category on NSView (though could be readily converted to CGPoint/CGRect for iOS use)

Some trivial helpers for rects & points but most notably a couple of methods to allow you to calculate the point on the edge of a rectangle that a line passing through the center of that rectangle will hit.
